# JT Houk -- @HoukasaurusRex

My name is JT and I make software for a living. Currently I live in Beijing where I operate the Akkadu

livestream interpretation platform.

In addition to my professional work, I also produce a lot of open source software (mostly tools I develop for myself that I find might be useful for others as well), and contribute to a few open source projects.

Node.js is my bread and butter, and on the front end my tool of choice is always Vue.js (including for this site). I'm also proficient in many other languages, operating systems, cloud providers, and frameworks such as Python, React, Shell Scripting, Linux, AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.

## My Values

* Growth Mindsets
* Positive Working Environments
* Beginner's Curiosity and Old Hat's Patience
* Trust and Cooperative Environments

## How I Work

I'm motivated by curiosity and positive impacts on the world. Working with new technologies is something I can't resist. I hope to master a few languages, human and computer, but also play with a great many others. I also believe companies of all sizes have more responsibility to creating positive change in the world, and I would like to be a part of that development in humanity. I care most about contributing to environmental change, protecting basic human rights, and promoting the accessibility of the web and its vast network of knowledge to all of humankind.
