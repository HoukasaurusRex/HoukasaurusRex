## How I Work

I'm motivated by curiosity and positive impacts on the world. Working with new technologies is something I can't resist. I hope to master a few languages, human and computer, but also play with a great many others. I also believe companies of all sizes have more responsibility to creating positive change in the world, and I would like to be a part of that development in humanity. I care most about contributing to environmental change, protecting basic human rights, and promoting the accessibility of the web and its vast network of knowledge to all of humankind.
